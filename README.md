Personal Information Management(PIM) takes into account not just the techniques used to gather, organize, and store information, but is also interested in how individuals 
access information from their collections for subsequent uses.Individuals may maintain and govern their online identities themselves thanks to PIMS.A client/server program 
called PIMS is used to collect, show, archive, and report information from a range of plant, business, and control systems.Personal information refers to facts about an 
individual, such as their name, age, place of residence, phone number, email address, physical description, and information about their parents and kids.You may manage all  
of the student's personal information, including their passport-size photo, as well as their family and past employers' details. From the administration of person details area, 
users can also add and update persons.To create this system, I drew on my knowledge of computer languages like JavaScript, PHP, HTML5, and CSS3, as well as development tools 
like Visual Studio Code, XAMPP, and Bootstrap, AJAX, and JQuery plugings.
